# Temporary-Happiness
## Overview
A simple text classifier

## Dataset
* dataset courtesy of [t-davidson](https://github.com/t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language/tree/master/data)
* **Choice of dataset is temporary and will be revisited!**

## Environment
* Python 3.7
* Anaconda environment
  * TensorFlow 2.1

## File descriptions
* [model.py](https://github.com/mikepatel/Temporary-Happiness/blob/master/model.py) for model definition
* [parameters.py](https://github.com/mikepatel/Temporary-Happiness/blob/master/parameters.py) for model parameters
* [train.py](https://github.com/mikepatel/Temporary-Happiness/blob/master/train.py) for model training and prediction

## Instructions
Temporarily using train.py to train AND to also perform inference (will save trained model in the future)
```
python train.py
```
